    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>I am a Fullstack Developer in the analytics team at Siemens Mobility, where I build web applications that showcase insights derived from extensive data analysis. This involves designing and developing apps that present data in a meaningful way to support various use cases. To make the data ready for these applications, I do ETL processes using PL/SQL within our PostgreSQL database, ensuring the data is structured and accessible for effective use.</p>
    <p>Our entire environment is hosted in the AWS cloud, allowing for scalable and reliable deployments. Additionally, I have developed an awareness system using Apache Airflow that monitors data consistency and alerts the team when inconsistencies arise, ensuring data integrity across our workflows.</p>
